For the purposes of this exercise, we already generated a clef masterkey.

The masterkey.json was included in this repository **for testing purposes only**.

*********** YOU SHOULD NEVER COMMIT REAL SECRETS TO ANY REPOSITORY! ***********

You should treat masterseed.json with utmost secrecy and make a backup of it!
* The password is necessary but not enough, you need to back up the master seed too!
* The master seed does not contain your accounts, those need to be backed up separately!

*********** PLEASE NEVER USE THIS PASSWORD IN A REAL LIFE SCENARIO! ***********

---

This masterseed.json file was generated using:

    $ clef --configdir ./clef --suppress-bootwarn init

with password:

    ahJ0ieth*ah*l8shied9cheephaiCee8o
